          <p>
            <strong>In Short:</strong> If you choose to register or log in to
            our services using a social media account, we may have access to
            certain information about you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your
            third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or
            Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive
            certain profile information about you from your social media
            provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on
            the social media provider concerned, but will often include your
            name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as
            other information you choose to make public on such a social media
            platform. If you log in using Facebook, we may also request access
            to other permissions related to your account, such as your friends,
            check-ins, and likes, and you may choose to grant or deny us access
            to each individual permission.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that
            are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made
            clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not
            control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal
            information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend
            that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect,
            use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your
            privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
          </p>
          <h5>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h5>
          <p>
            <strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as
            necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice
            unless otherwise required by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
            necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
            longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
            tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this
            notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer
            than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
            personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
            information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
            personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we
            will securely store your personal information and isolate it from
            any further processing until deletion is possible.
          </p>
          <h5>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h5>
          <p>
            <strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal
            information through a system of organizational and technical
            security measures.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
            organizational security measures designed to protect the security of
            any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards
            and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission
            over the Internet or information storage technology can be
            guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that
            hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will
            not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access,
            steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
            protect your personal information, transmission of personal
            information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should
            only access the Services within a secure environment.
          </p>
          <h5>8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h5>
          <p>
            <strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or
            market to children under 18 years of age.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18
            years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at
            least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and
            consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn
            that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has
            been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
            measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you
            become aware of any data we may have collected from children under
            age 18, please contact us at .

            determine you are the same person about whom we have the information
            in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to
            provide information so that we can match it with information you
            have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of
            request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so
            that we can match the information you provide with the information
            we already have on file, or we may contact you through a
            communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously
            provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the
            circumstances dictate.

            possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you
            for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your
            identity from the information already maintained by us, we may
            request that you provide additional information for the purposes of
            verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention
            purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as
            soon as we finish verifying you.
